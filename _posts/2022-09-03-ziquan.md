## Abstract
The past decade has witnessed a great advancement on the Tate conjecture for varieties with Hodge number $$ h^{2,0} = 1 $$. Charles, Madapusi-Pera and Maulik completely settled the conjecture for K3 surfaces over finite fields, and Moonen proved the Mumford-Tate (and hence also Tate) conjecture for more or less arbitrary $$ h^{2,0} = 1 $$ varieties in characteristic $$ 0 $$.

In this talk, I will explain that the Tate conjecture is true for mod $$ p $$ reductions of complex projective $$ h^{2,0} = 1 $$ varieties when $$ p \gg 0 $$, under a mild assumption on moduli. By refining this general result, we prove that in characteristic $$ p \geq 5 $$ the BSD conjecture holds for a height 1 elliptic curve $$ E $$ over a function field of genus $$ 1 $$, as long as $$ E $$ is subject to the generic condition that all singular fibers in its minimal compacification are irreducible. We also prove the Tate conjecture over finite fields for a class of surfaces of general type and a class of Fano varieties. The overall philosphy is that the connection between the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Lefschetz $$ (1, 1) $$-theorem over $$ \mathbb{C} $$ is very robust for $$ h^{2,0} = 1 $$ varieties, and works well beyond the hyperk√§hler world.

This is based on joint work with Paul Hamacher and Xiaolei Zhao.
